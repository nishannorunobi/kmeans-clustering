199,17509,"At Golden Globes Afterparties, Stars Applaud Meryl Streep - The New York Times",New York Times,Cara Buckley,2017-01-10,2017.0,1.0,,"At the Golden Globes afterparties, hoi polloi who aren’t invited to the ceremony descend by the thousands on the Beverly Hilton to whoop it up and stalk celebrities. Hosts of this year’s Hilton parties  —   held in ballrooms and massive tents around its compound  —   included HBO, the Weinstein Company, Fox, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Amazon, Warner Bros. and InStyle. The biggest stars often skipped those parties altogether, and instead beelined to the exclusive talent agency fests, held at the Sunset Tower Hotel and the Chateau Marmont. Confined to the Hilton, the Bagger joined the star stalkers herself, seeking answers to the burning question: What did celebrities think of Meryl Streep’s speech? (For a general idea, click here). The Bagger first cornered the preternaturally glamorous Joan Collins, as the British actress was carefully ascending a small flight of stairs at the Fox party. “I think she is one of the greatest actresses of a generation,” Ms. Collins said of Ms. Streep. “She has the right to say whatever she wants. And I think if you look at people’s faces in the audience, people went along with her. ” At the HBO party, Eddie Redmayne said he found Ms. Streep’s speech “incredibly emotional,” but was so distracted by her presence in the audience while presenting the award for best musical or comedy that he almost forgot to read the nominees. He wouldn’t say whether he thought Hollywood should take a page from Ms. Streep and speak out politically. The Bagger nabbed Bryan Cranston at the HBO party, too. Mr. Cranston, who has spoofed a Donald J. Trump presidency on “Saturday Night Live,” got a little misty just speaking about Ms. Streep’s words. “She was able to deliver an important message that resonated with all of us, with grace and dignity and no vitriol or hyperbole,” he said, “It was just beautifully delivered, to convey the anxiety that we are feeling, and the concern. ” Vince Vaughn, who has supported Republican presidential candidates in the past, was chatting a few feet away, so the Bagger asked him, too. Did he think Ms. Streep’s speech was an example of how Hollywood should respond to the politics of our time? “I think people should say what they want to say, and what she said was beautiful,” Mr. Vaughn said. The Bagger’s eyes then fell on John Corbett, a. k. a. Aidan from “Sex and the City. ” Was Hollywood the platform to address politics? “A whole lot of ‘Apprentice’ watchers just elected the president of the United States,” Mr. Corbett said, breaking into a dazzler of a grin, “so I guess it is!” The night ended on a high note, with Kerry Washington, who was at the party with her husband, Nnamdi Asomugha, agreeing to weigh in. (“One question!” her manager told the Bagger.) Ms. Washington said she found Ms. Streep’s speech beautiful too, adding that in a democracy, there’s never a time when citizens, whatever their stripe, shouldn’t speak out. “I don’t think that people of Hollywood should be silenced because of what we do for a living,” Ms. Washington said. “I don’t think it’s important that she said what she said because she’s an actress. I think it’s important she said what she said because she’s a citizen. We all have a First Amendment right of free speech. ”"
200,17510,The Best and Worst of the Golden Globes - The New York Times,New York Times,,2017-01-10,2017.0,1.0,,"Here’s a look at the most memorable moments from the 2017 Golden Globes, including Meryl Streep’s acceptance speech, Jimmy Fallon’s lackluster hosting, funny presenters and awkward flubs. Meryl Streep campaigned on behalf of Hillary Clinton, so expectations were high that when she took the Golden Globes stage to accept the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she would comment on the recent election. But how political would she be? Pretty political, as it turned out. She used her speech to call out   Donald J. Trump for seeming to mock a disabled New York Times reporter, and to warn that a free press would need to be defended. “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” she said. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. ” The room roundly applauded her remarks, but on social media some conservative commentators immediately criticized her and the target of her remarks had his own take. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Streep as “a Hillary lover” and said that while he had not watched the ceremony, he was “not surprised” to come under attack from “liberal movie people. ”  —   Daniel Victor and Patrick Healy Read the full text of Meryl Streep’s remarks and read more about the  ’s comments. Jimmy Fallon, generally an ebullient cruise director for awards shows, wasn’t a presence so much as a nuisance. The “La La Land” intro only really worked if you’d already seen “La La Land,” and the segment lacked the pep and fun of, for example, his “Glee”  musical intro to the 2010 Emmys. There was barely a monologue, but a teleprompter snafu probably shouldn’t derail a comedian who hosts a TV show five nights a week. The rest of his material was tiny  —   and not funny  —   interstitials introducing the presenters with strained wordplay. Does this show need a host? Maybe not.  —   Margaret Lyons Read a review of the telecast. Even cynical   watchers had to smile when the songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, ages 31 and 32, came bounding onto the stage to collect their Globe for the moody “La La Land” tune “City of Stars. ” The young men had clearly not yet received the show business memo that awards are to be accepted with practiced (false) modesty and coolness. “We need to calm down!” shouted Mr. Paul. “We’re so nervous!” They charmingly dedicated their best song award to “musical theater nerds everywhere. ” (Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul also wrote the music for the celebrated “Dear Evan Hansen. ”) The same kind of emotion could also been seen whenever the cameras passed the “La La Land” table, where the two producers who shepherded the film the longest, Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz, ages 35 and 36, could be seen melting down with joy as their film racked up one prize after another. Add in multiple trips to the stage by the film’s director, Damien Chazelle, 31, and it felt like an arrival moment for a new set of Young Turks. On to the Oscars?  —   Brooks Barnes Read about the making of “La La Land. ” There’s no movie called “Hidden Fences. ” There’s “Fences,” starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, and there’s “Hidden Figures,” starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe. First Jenna Bush Hager said it on NBC’s red carpet show when she was interviewing Pharrell Williams (who is a producer of “Hidden Figures”) and then Michael Keaton said it onstage. Look alive out there, folks.  —   Margaret Lyons Read about Pharrell Williams’s reaction. Donald Glover’s two acceptance speeches for his work on the FX show “Atlanta” were touching and personal (“I grew up in a house where magic wasn’t allowed”) and also hilarious (“I’d like to thank the Migos  —   not for being on the show, but for making ‘Bad and Boujee.’ That’s the best song ever”). “Atlanta” was one of the best, most distinctive shows of last season, and everything about the show’s win, and Mr. Glover’s velvet suit, and the cast’s   portrait felt unique and just right.  —   Margaret Lyons Read the complete list of Golden Globe winners. It was a night of facial hair and sparkles, fairy princess frocks and character dressing, with the characters, and the (Hollywood) royals, dressed straight from the silver screen playbook. Of course, some costumes are less obvious than others. And when it comes to the red carpet, at least pretending to dress as yourself as opposed to, say, a cut flower or Disney caricature, has power. Ruth Negga, for example, in a   sequined   gown (who doesn’t love the idea of a   gown?) by Louis Vuitton, took the idea of dressing for the award you want, a popular seasonal trope, and gave it a dose of futuristic cool. Evan Rachel Wood, channeling Marlene Dietrich and David Bowie (and Julie Andrews in “ ”) in an exactingly cut Altuzarra tux with white vest, offered absolute proof of her words that when it comes to awards season, there was no dress required. And Thandie Newton, in    white Monse, flames picked out in paillettes licking up her hem, just hinted at the idea of an avenging angel come to earth. Also on the   list, though in a more classical mode: Emma Stone, in     (pink was a trend) Valentino, metaphor obvious but still undeniably enchanting Brie Larson, in strapless red Rodarte with a draped and beaded bodice, matching lips and Veronica Lake hair Natalie Portman, in ’  chartreuse Prada maternity gown, a little “Jackie,” but not too much and Viola Davis in sunshine yellow   sequined Michael Kors, so bright she gave off her own light. For good or ill, Fashion with a capital F dresses can often look overdone or out of place on what has become a pretty visually safe space, and such was the case with Nicole Kidman’s Scottish shipwreck of a   corseted Alexander McQueen. Ditto Sarah Jessica Parker’s white   Vera Wang, with its echoes of both wedding dresses past and Princess Leia. And ditto Janelle Monáe’s   Armani: short in front, trailing in back, sequined on top. Just when you had taken one detail in: whoa! There was another. The red carpet just doesn’t reward risk. At least the very boring  —   all those sequined columns, yawn  —   doesn’t linger long in the brain.  —   Vanessa Friedman Read a review of the night’s looks and see a red carpet slide show. In “Nocturnal Animals,” Tom Ford’s twisty drama, Aaron   plays a sadistic thug who menaces a family on a deserted highway. Critics singled out the terrifying performance but on the awards circuit so far, the actor had garnered just one award (from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival) before his surprise Golden Globe for best supporting actor. Left   were favorites like Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”). On the red carpet, Mr.   said he watched movies about Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer to prepare, while his wife, the director Sam   confessed, “It wasn’t my favorite part. ”  —   Stephanie Goodman  Read a review of “Nocturnal Animals. ” Tracee Ellis Ross’s acceptance speech was an elegant combination of meaningful ideas and gleeful spontaneity. Winning the Globe for best actress in a comedy (“ ”) Ms. Ross said that her award was also for “all of the women, women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas and thoughts are not always considered worthy and valid and important. ” She said that it’s “an honor” to be on a show that tells stories “outside of where the industry usually looks. ” She also seemed absolutely delighted to have won. Isn’t this what we want from an acceptance speech? A little humor, a bit of thoughtfulness, some seemingly true human emotion.  —   Margaret Lyons Read more about Tracee Ellis Ross’s speech. It’s time to retire “Sofia Vergara is not a native English speaker” as a comic premise. She came out and said “anal” twice and then “anus,” the big joke being that she can’t pronounce “annual. ”  —   Margaret Lyons Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig’s introduction for best animated feature was hilarious. And thank God  —   the otherwise abysmal banter segments were draining every iota of energy out of the ceremony.  —   Margaret Lyons The actors who really stole the show were, for the most part, under the age of 15: the kids from “Stranger Things” and Sunny Pawar, the   Indian actor who played a lost child in “Lion. ” The “Stranger Things” boys  —   Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp  —   arrived together, charming the red carpet  with their sharp outfits and snappy moves. Caleb later grabbed a selfie with Ryan Gosling during a commercial break. And onstage during the show, when Sunny was hoisted up to the mic by Dev Patel, who plays the older version of their character in the drama “Lion,” the entire ballroom erupted in awws and coos, the sound of hundreds of hearts melting.  —   Cara Buckley Read a review of “Lion” and a review of “Stranger Things. ”"
201,17511,Trump Was the Elephant in the Ballroom at the Golden Globes - The New York Times,New York Times,James Poniewozik,2017-01-09,2017.0,1.0,,"The biggest presence at Sunday’s Golden Globes was a TV star who didn’t show up, didn’t win an award, was not thanked and was only rarely mentioned by name. Hollywood’s first awards show of the year was  —   like so much in today’s headlines  —   brought to you by Donald J. Trump. Even before Meryl Streep took the   to the   he loomed over Jimmy Fallon’s monologue. The last time Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Fallon on NBC’s “The Tonight Show,” the host tousled his hair during a softball interview. Mr. Trump’s subsequent election was both an affirmation of celebrity’s power and a repudiation of most celebrities’ politics. So beyond “Moonlight” versus “Manchester by the Sea,” a big question hanging over the awards was how, or whether, Mr. Fallon would address the Republican elephant in the room. The night began with exactly the kind of bit you’d figure Mr. Fallon would start with: a   parody of scenes from the musical mash note to Los Angeles, “La La Land. ” It was a fitting choice, if not an especially hilarious one, at the most escapist of awards shows. Music and   comedy are the strength of Mr. Fallon’s “The Tonight Show. ” (He brought his bandleader, Questlove, along as D. J.) And just as “La La Land” is a bubbly tribute to performers and their dreams, Mr. Fallon’s talk show is a stage for celebrities  —   and politicians  —   to perform their likability. In his monologue, Mr. Fallon seemed determined to show that his   hand had claws. He said the awards results were “tabulated by the firm of Ernst  Young and Putin. ” Referencing “Game of Thrones” fans who wondered what would have happened if King Joffrey  —   the show’s sadistic, petty    —   had lived, he said, “in 12 days we’re going to find out. ” His   jokes felt out of character the rest were ordinary. (He did show off his talent for impressions, doing a Chris Rock that reminded us how sharp Mr. Rock had been at the Oscars.) The most memorable part may have been at the beginning, when Mr. Fallon’s Teleprompter went out. He vamped for a bit, and after the commercial break he returned with a joke  —   likening his mishap to Mariah Carey’s singing disaster on New Year’s Eve  —   that it seemed half of Twitter had already made at that point. Mr. Fallon handled his technical   much better than the diva. But he didn’t make much of it either, and that summed up the night. He wasn’t bad this year just didn’t seem like his cultural moment. You had to wonder what last year’s host, the vitriolic Ricky Gervais, might have done, or Mr. Fallon’s other predecessors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who made acerbic jokes in good fun. Entertainers can make an audience forget the turbulent times with a tour de force performance. (See Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig, who did a brilliant bit about their first visits to the movies going horribly wrong  —   someone might want to call their agents and lock them down to host next year.) They can make art out of troubles. (See many of the night’s winners, such as the     “The People v. O. J. Simpson. ”) Or they can lay it between the lines. Hugh Laurie seemed to compare his character in “The Night Manager” to the  : “I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere. ” It was Meryl Streep, receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award, who repudiated Mr. Trump, for a “performance” during the campaign in which he mocked a disabled reporter. “It sank its hooks in my heart,” she said. Call me biased (that reporter is a colleague at The Times) but it was as passionate and devastating as any scripted clip played that night. Ms. Streep also said that without Hollywood’s performers from around the world, “you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts. ” Did that persuade anyone for whom those   are entertainment? There is a school of thought that it does nobody good for celebrities to deliver political diatribes, coded or not, on a night that celebrates the fortune of the fortunate. But their work says something, like it or not. The 2016 election was, among other things, a cultural argument: overtly and subtextually, it was in part about how comfortable America was with change, diversity and inclusion  —   about whether there was some   homogeneous “greatness” that America had lost. The awards, and the acceptances, often served as an answer, a message that the social gears have not totally been thrown in reverse. “Moonlight,” a film about a young black man growing up gay, won best drama. FX’s “Atlanta,” set in the   scene of the Georgia city, won best TV comedy or musical, and its creator, Donald Glover (who also won best actor in a comedy or musical) thanked “all the black folks in Atlanta. ” And Tracee Ellis Ross, star of “ ” (whose title Mr. Trump once railed against on Twitter) dedicated her award to women of color: “I want you to know that I see you. We see you. ” Sometimes, this Globescast said, art is an escape. Sometimes it’s a call to arms. And sometimes seeing, and being seen, is a statement in itself."
202,17514,A Permanent Plinth for New Art Coming to the High Line - The New York Times,New York Times,Randy Kennedy,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"London has its Fourth Plinth, where contemporary artists have graced  —   and sometimes goaded  —   viewers in Trafalgar Square with sculptural work on a bare pedestal originally intended for an equestrian statue of William IV. Now New York will have its own plinth, a highly visible permanent stage for ambitious new international sculpture commissions, perched above 30th Street and 10th Avenue on one of the final sections of the High Line. This plinth, expected to open sometime in 2018, will likely change sizes and shapes depending on the artwork intended for it. It is a new creation by the High Line, being built on the spur that turns east at 30th Street, creating a corner that forms a kind of plaza, roomy enough for crowds and for larger sculpture than the narrow elevated park now accommodates. Cecilia Alemani, the director and chief curator of High Line Art, said that the development of the spur, which will be ringed by the skyscrapers of the new Hudson Yards office complex, prompted her and High Line officials to think about a stage that would hold its own with   public art sites like Rockefeller Center, City Hall Park and Madison Square Park. The plinth will be tall enough so that work on it will be instantly visible from the street, but on the High Line itself the space will be flanked by trees, making entering it feel something like walking into a clearing. “It’s almost like a jungle,” she said during a recent tour of the plaza’s construction site. “It’s like you leave the city for a while and go somewhere else. And it’s given us really the only place where we’ll have the ability to put   pieces, which will be like a punctuation in a beautiful piazza. ” Sculptures will remain on view for a year and a half at a time. The program will be funded by the Friends of the High Line and private donors at a cost that was not disclosed. Calls for art work went out quietly last year, and more than 50 artists submitted proposals. An advisory committee of prominent artists and curators  —   including Helen Molesworth, the chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and Franklin Sirmans, the director of the Pérez Art Museum in Miami  —   helped draw up the full roster of artists to be considered, and by spring a list of a dozen finalists will be narrowed to two by High Line officials. The short list includes veterans like Charles Gaines and the sculptor Haim Steinbach (who has proposed a piece resembling a chicken coop on stilts, a kind of comic vision of a penthouse) and   younger artists like Jeremy Deller, Matthew Day Jackson, Cosima von Bonin and Sam Durant, whose proposal is the most overtly political, a large sculptural version of a drone with wings stretched out over the High Line as if it were approaching Midtown for a missile launch. (In London in 2009, the artist Antony Gormley used the Fourth Plinth as a human stage, enlisting volunteers, some in various states of undress, to serve as the sculpture. “Nakedness is to art,” Mr. Gormley said, “what the ball is to football. ”) The other High Line finalists include Jonathan Berger, Minerva Cuevas, Lena Henke, Roman Ondak, Paola Pivi and Simone Leigh. Ms. Leigh has proposed a    bust of a black female figure whose body evokes both a skirt and a hut, based on smaller figures that have long been part of her work. In an interview, she said that the muscular,   site of the plinth was a place “I found a really horrifying environment for my work when I first saw it. ” She added, “And then I thought: ‘What better place to put a black female figure?’ Not in defiance of the space, exactly, but to have a different idea of beauty there. ”"
203,17515,Smithsonian Hears Call for Women’s Museum - The New York Times,New York Times,Graham Bowley,2017-01-10,2017.0,1.0,,"Leading women from politics, the arts and other fields urged   Donald Trump on Monday to support a new national women’s museum in Washington that would be affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. At a meeting in New York to give momentum to the idea, the group cited the report of a bipartisan Congressional commission in November that urged construction of the museum. “It’s tremendously important,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who first proposed the project in the late 1990s. “How can you empower women if they are not even recognized?” The commission recommended “a national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country. ” The commission did not specify a site but said its preference was for the museum, to be called the American Museum of Women’s History, to be located prominently in the capital, on or close to the National Mall. The museum will require legislation to become a reality. Emily K. Rafferty, former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of the commissioners who produced the congressional report, said, “The women’s tale has not been revealed, has not been properly identified or properly articulated. ” The commission proposed that the government provide the land or an existing building for the museum. Private   of about $150 million to $180 million would pay for construction costs, it said. A spokeswoman for the Smithsonian, Linda St. Thomas, said its secretary does not believe the institution is in a position to establish a new museum at this time, but was committed to representing the contributions of women in all the Smithsonian’s museums. Last year on the Mall, the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the 19th museum or gallery in the Smithsonian portfolio."
204,17516,Looking at Your Home Planet from Mars - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas St. Fleur,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,"Greetings Earthlings! This is your planet and its moon as seen from Mars, some 127 million miles away. This composite image, which was released by NASA on Friday, was created using a special camera aboard the agency’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is a spacecraft orbiting about 180 miles above the red planet. The camera is called the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment. It provides scientists with detailed views of the Martian surface so they can better study geological features like its volcanoes and gullies, as well as scope out potential landing sites for future missions. “It’s the biggest telescope ever sent to another planet,” said Alfred McEwen a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and the principal investigator of HiRise. Dr. McEwen said that the image was taken while NASA researchers were trying to calibrate the camera. NASA knows precisely what color the moon’s near side is, so when it wants to calibrate HiRise, it points it at the moon and takes some images. NASA then analyzes the pictures and if the colors appear off it can correct the calibration. “The moon is boring. It doesn’t change, it’s relatively bland and it doesn’t have all of these variations or changing clouds. It’s a good calibration target,” Dr. McEwen said. “The Earth is a bad calibration target with all its variability like clouds and such, but it makes a pretty picture. ” Earth and the moon appear close in this image, but that is because the moon is actually just behind Earth. The researchers had to wait until the two celestial bodies were positioned like this because it provided them with the best view of the moon to perform their calibration, Dr. McEwen said. To make this picture, scientists combined two separate exposures taken on Nov. 20, 2016, which were processed differently. Dr. McEwen said that NASA needed two exposures to make this image because a good image of the moon saturates Earth, and a good image of Earth makes the moon appear too dark. Vegetation appears red in this image, according to Dr. McEwen. The red spot in the middle of Earth is Australia, the one on the top left is Southeast Asia and Antarctica is the bright white blob in the bottom left."
205,17517,Uber Extends an Olive Branch to Local Governments: Its Data - The New York Times,New York Times,Mike Isaac,2017-01-09,2017.0,1.0,,"The   company Uber and local governments often do not play well together. Uber pays little heed to regulation while city officials scramble to keep up with the company’s rapid deployment and surging popularity. But now, with a new   product, Uber is offering a tiny olive branch to its municipal critics. The company on Sunday unveiled Movement, a   website it hopes will persuade city planners to consider Uber as part of urban development and transit systems in the future. The site, which Uber will invite planning agencies and researchers to visit in the coming weeks, will allow outsiders to study traffic patterns and speeds across cities using data collected by tens of thousands of Uber vehicles. Users can use Movement to compare average trip times across certain points in cities and see what effect something like a baseball game might have on traffic patterns. Eventually, the company plans to make Movement available to the general public. If urban planners embrace the data, that could work toward a future Uber has long dreamed of, one in which the company’s transportation options are woven into municipal planning. “Our relationships with cities have typically been uneven, but there are a lot of places around the world where Uber and the cities we operate in have the same goals,” Andrew Salzberg, head of transportation policy at Uber, said in an interview. “We operate better in a world that has policy grounded on data. ” The collected trip data is made anonymous and aggregated, Uber said, which it hopes will assuage user privacy concerns. That data, Uber said, will most likely be much more reliable than what is typically used by urban planners, many of whom hire   agencies to study traffic patterns over time. Often, that data is expensive, and it can be out of date by the time it is analyzed. Uber argues that its data is more reliable because all of its drivers use smartphones equipped with accelerometers and global positioning technology. One challenge for Uber: improving upon the rocky partnerships it forged in the early,   data sharing deals it struck two years ago. In a widely publicized move in January 2015, Uber announced a deal with the city of Boston in which the company planned to share some anonymous data, with many of the same urban planning aspirations it has today. But that deal quickly soured. Boston officials said the agreement was not practical for city planning and development because it restricted what agencies the city could share the data with and because the data came only in quarterly batches. Boston city employees also grew frustrated with the lack of useful data being shared and Uber’s seeming lack of understanding of how to deal with city governments. “The totality of Uber and Lyft drivers in Boston represent what is effectively the addition of another transit line,” Jascha   chief information officer at Boston’s Department of Innovation  Technology, said in an interview. “The fact that we’re dealing with a whole new line that we don’t have data on and can’t integrate it into our planning is sort of ridiculous. ” Uber seemed to take the criticism to heart. After the Boston partnership, the company created a   team to develop an approach to sharing data with city planners across the world. Led by Jordan Gilbertson, a product manager at Uber, that project eventually became the new website, Movement. City officials said that they appreciated user data privacy concerns but that they also hoped to see more useful information from Uber. Mr.   shared a list of detailed requests that could aid future urban development, like demand patterns around   tenant housing, locations with likely potholes and the most common pickup and   locations. Uber maintains that it plans to release more data to cities over time as it rolls out the Movement tool to a wider audience of researchers and to the public. But the company said it would balance that demand for information with concerns about user privacy and the need to protect competitive data that could prove valuable to rivals like Lyft, Hailo and Grab, which are vying for riders across many of the same markets. “Ideally, we’ll someday find what that middle ground looks like,” Mr.   said."
206,17518,Is Edward Snowden a Spy? A New Book Calls Him One. - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas Lemann,2017-02-05,2017.0,2.0,,"HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETSEdward Snowden, the Man and the TheftBy Edward Jay EpsteinIllustrated. 350 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27. 95. People who reveal secrets are either heroes or betrayers, depending on what the secrets are and on the inclinations of the audience for them. In the case of Edward Snowden, who took and then released a great deal of internal data from the National Security Agency in 2013, his admirers have campaigned for a   pardon by President Obama, but Donald Trump has mused that execution might be more appropriate. Journalism based on Snowden’s revelations won the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2014, and the Oscar for best documentary in 2015 on the other hand, many American government officials think Snowden, who lives in Russia, should be brought home and prosecuted for revealing classified information. In 2014, Edward Jay Epstein, the veteran writer on espionage, published a provocative article in The Wall Street Journal proposing another way of looking at Snowden: as a spy. Epstein wrote that an unnamed “former member of President Obama’s cabinet” had told him “that there are only three possible explanations for the Snowden heist: 1) It was a Russian espionage operation 2) It was a Chinese espionage operation 3) It was a joint   operation. ” Now Epstein has produced a long, detailed book elaborating on his theory. Snowden is known for having revealed that the N. S. A. was illegally spying on American citizens, but Epstein says that he actually took almost a million documents that had nothing to do with that, which he didn’t give to journalists. What happened to them? How did a relatively lowly nonemployee at the agency, without much official access, manage to get all that material in the first place? Why did he choose to announce himself to the world from Hong Kong, and why has he remained in Moscow since he left Hong Kong? You can see the outlines of a coherent hypothesis in “How America Lost Its Secrets. ” Perhaps Snowden was planted at the N. S. A. by either Russia or China, or by both. Perhaps while he was there he worked with other, as yet undetected, insiders who were also serving foreign powers. Perhaps in Hong Kong he put himself into the care of Chinese handlers who debriefed him extensively during the nearly two weeks between his arrival and his  . Perhaps the same thing happened in Moscow during the first 37 days after he landed there, when he seems to have been hiding somewhere inside the airport security perimeter. Perhaps his reward for, in effect, defecting has been the odd protected life in Russia that celebrated spies like Kim Philby and Guy Burgess previously enjoyed. Perhaps his   role as a   was merely a counterintuitive (because it was so public) new form of cover. Epstein proves none of this. “How America Lost Its Secrets” is an impressively fluffy and   wobbly soufflé of speculation, full of anonymous sourcing and suppositional language like “it seems plausible to believe” or “it doesn’t take a great stretch of the imagination to conclude. ” Epstein’s first book, “Inquest,” published more than 50 years ago, featured another mysterious young man who spent time in Moscow, Lee Harvey Oswald. This book has a   feeling, because it touches on several of Epstein’s   preoccupations: Russia the movie and media businesses the gullibility of liberals and, especially, the world of penetration, exfiltration, false flags and other aspects of counterintelligence. The spirit of James Jesus Angleton, the C. I. A. ’s   counterintelligence chief during the peak years of the Cold War and evidently a mentor to Epstein (he’s mentioned several times) hovers over these pages. Sometimes it seems as if Epstein so much enjoys exploring the twists and turns in Snowden’s story  —   his encounter with Snowden’s mysterious lawyer in Moscow, Anatoly Kucherena, is especially memorable  —   that he doesn’t have an overwhelming need to settle the questions he raises. The sentence from The Wall Street Journal quoted above appears almost verbatim in the book, but it’s immediately followed by this: “These severe accusations generated much heat but little light. They were not accompanied by any evidence showing that Snowden had acted in concert with any foreign power in stealing the files or, for that matter, that he was not acting out of his own personal convictions, no matter how misguided they might have been. ” But then Epstein spends many more pages considering, and not dismissing, the very same severe accusations, and ends by saying that “Snowden’s theft of state secrets . ’u2008. ’u2008. had evolved, deliberately or not, but necessarily, into a mission of disclosing key national secrets to a foreign power. ” This is Epstein’s primary conclusion: Even if the American public was a partial beneficiary of Snowden’s revelations, the main beneficiary was Russia, which to his mind couldn’t possibly have failed to take possession of all the material Snowden took from the N. S. A. Whatever caveats he uses and whatever hard evidence he hasn’t found, Epstein clearly wants to leave readers with the impression that Snowden remains in Russia as a result of a deal exchanging his information for its protection. He repeatedly hints that he has reason to be more certain about his conclusion than he’s able to say in print. Snowden, Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, and their immediate circle of allies come from a radically libertarian hacker culture that, most of the time, doesn’t believe there should be an N. S. A. at all, whether or not it remains within the confines of its legal charter. Epstein, conversely, is a strong supporter of the agency’s official mission of “communication intercepts,” which he sees as an essential element in the United States’ ability to participate in “the game of nations. ” To him one of the lessons of the Snowden case is that the agency’s reliance on private contractors like Snowden instead of career employees has made it dangerously vulnerable to security breaches. It’s an irony of the years since the Reagan revolution that one political strain in the United States, suspicion of big government, has led to spending and staffing limits that have pushed the N. S. A. into the   private marketplace to perform its   mission. (The contractor that employed Snowden had been acquired by a private equity firm that was pressuring it to cut costs, and elaborate background checks are expensive.) That conflicts with another strain of modern conservatism, support for a vast   apparatus. Whatever his motive, Snowden found a way to arbitrage that contradiction. The age of the internet, Vladimir Putin, Snowden and WikiLeaks has generated its own particular form of disruption around how we think about the revelation of government secrets. Traditional spies seem far less important these days, because unclubbable, technically adept people can do that kind of work far more effectively. The press, at least for now, has assumed a larger role in the ecosystem of revelation, because hackers prefer finding partners in the mainstream media to simply releasing information on their own. But this new set of arrangements makes journalists look more like conduits and contextualizers, and less like originators of information. Reporters aren’t supposed to be hackers themselves (see the News of the World scandals in London five years ago) but they’re not capable of resisting juicy information that others have hacked, no matter how unsavory the purpose (see the ubiquitous coverage of John Podesta’s   private emails during the fall campaign). Journalists are quite comfortable with the idea of the news media uncovering government secrets that should not have been secret in the first place. This may be a role whose run is coming to an end. Information is too copious and flows too freely, and there are too many players in the revelation game  —   political activists, foreign governments, tricksters,    —   for journalists to function as the arbiters of revelation. If there isn’t any longer going to be one trustworthy group in society, the established press, that acts as a benign check on excessive government secrecy, the discussion of what should and shouldn’t be secret becomes a lot messier. Epstein has long been annoyed with the idea of the press as the key actor in secrecy dramas, digging up what the public should know but not exposing everything  . Way back in 1974, he published an article in Commentary called “Did the Press Uncover Watergate?” (His answer: no.) This time around, his concern seems to be half with the celebratory closed loop between Snowden and the journalists who covered him, and half with the causes and consequences of a major security breach at the N. S. A. The heart of the matter is the second of these concerns, not the first. In the Snowden affair, the press didn’t decide what stayed secret, and neither did Congress, the White House or the N. S. A. Snowden did."
207,17519,Casey Affleck: ‘Thanks for Dressing Up’ - The New York Times,New York Times,Guy Trebay,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"To be fair to Casey Affleck, he is not the biggest schlump in show business. Adam Sandler takes that prize. And let’s state upfront that we are talking here strictly in sartorial terms. There is plenty to be said about the more serious of Mr. Affleck’s shortcomings, the ones that have led him to settle two sexual harassment cases out of court and that some say may cost him the Oscar. For present purposes, however, what concerns us is Mr. Affleck’s bizarro style, a kind of slovenly and idiosyncratic take on normcore that conjures up images of every high school stoner you have ever met. Lately, the star has been seen in public a lot, picking up prize statuary and barnstorming the   circuit  —   from Jimmy Kimmel to Jimmy Fallon to “Saturday Night Live”  —   for “Manchester by the Sea. ” In this immaculately calibrated Kenneth Lonergan   Mr. Affleck plays a Boston handyman descended into a fugue of volatile,   depression after a tragic series of events. Making his strongest bid yet for an Oscar, the perennially underestimated actor gives a performance so tightly coiled that it threatens at times to crash projection software in theaters and plunge audiences into the dark. Slogging his way toward the biggest award show, in February, Mr. Affleck has so far picked up Golden Globe, Gotham, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle and Critics’ Choice trophies. And he has become, for now, a regular presence in the press and on television, the thinking person’s Bill and Ted. “Thanks for dressing up,” Stephen Colbert said to Mr. Affleck last February, when he appeared on “The Late Show” to promote his previous movie, the crime thriller “Triple 9. ” Mr. Colbert was referring to Mr. Affleck’s hardly bothering  : a pair of roomy khakis, sneakers, a rumpled blazer and an untucked   shirt. His hair, as is customary, looked as though he had combed it with salad tongs. “I can’t tell whether this choice is the least celebrity thing to do or the most celebrity thing to do, because it’s very casual,” Mr. Colbert told the actor, whom he went on to liken, with some accuracy, to a “  Jesus. ” Mr. Affleck, of course, is far from the first star to use clothes to register his pointed indifference to the industry’s sports jacket or penguin suit conventions. Turning up on Jon Stewart’s Comedy Central show, Mr. Sandler once wore an oversize corduroy shirt jacket he termed a “shacket” while flogging a forgettable 2011 movie titled “Jack and Jill. ” At the time, Mr. Sandler said his wife had purchased the shacket in a bid to upgrade his wardrobe, though to the average viewer, the garment looked like something found on a Greyound bus. When compared with Mr. Sandler, with his customary Stu Pickles   Mr. Affleck is a   Cary Grant. He appears to own a blazer and a suit or two, and can seemingly knot a tie. True, those ties tend to migrate off the centerline, his shirt collars curl at the ends, and his hairstyles skew messianic. But at least he has not been seen in public wearing sweatpants featuring the dorsal cleavage often referred to as plumber’s   …     never mind. “Casey always looks vaguely unshowered anyway, in real life, as well,” said Melissa Toth, whose meticulous work on “Manchester by the Sea” is a master class in cinematic costume design. “He’s a scruffy boy. ” The   scruff on his chin is occupational, Mr. Affleck explained in   on “Saturday Night Live,” grown for a part. Yet the truth is, it has been some time since anyone has spotted the      actor without the chin whiskers that are the male version of the eyeglasses pretty girls sometimes wear to make themselves look smart. “Scraggly” was the term Mr. Affleck applied to his beard on “Saturday Night Live,” and “not in a Santa way, more of a ‘Duck Dynasty’ way. ” And if scraggly is the image he has cultivated in almost every appearance, it’s a look he may decide to polish when Oscar season rolls around in full. After years spent “banging on Hollywood’s door,” as Variety said in October, the time may have come, with “Manchester by the Sea,” for Mr. Affleck to break through to the big leagues. And when he does  —   as odds suggest is likely  —   he may want to spring for a   shave and a jacket that fits, and learn to tuck in his shirt, industry experts say. “As a sign of respect, it is better to err on the side of dressing too well than not dressing enough,” said Rob Burnett, the longtime executive producer of “Late Show With David Letterman. ” “You want to avoid the possibility of ever looking like you don’t care. ” What should never happen, Mr. Burnett added, is that a   host like Mr. Fallon, Mr. Colbert or Mr. Kimmel takes an appraising look at an actor dressed in clothes you might wear to clean out the attic and says, “Oh, thanks for dressing up. ”"
208,17520,Jeff Sessions Says He Would Be Independent and Stand Up to Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lichtblau and Matt Apuzzo,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Senator Jeff Sessions,   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, pledged on Tuesday to “say no” to Mr. Trump if he tries to go beyond the law, and he spoke out against torture, a ban on Muslim immigration and other ideas that had been floated by Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions, a deeply conservative Republican from Alabama who was an early Trump supporter, appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Sessions and his allies had girded for a coordinated attack on his civil rights record, but Democrats tempered their criticism and Republicans mounted a   defense, describing him repeatedly as a man of integrity. In his two decades on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sessions has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, has said courts have interpreted the separation of church and state too broadly and has declared   marriage a threat to American culture. He also voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Much of the hearing focused on Mr. Sessions’s long record as a prosecutor and a senator, but Mr. Trump proved a dominant figure in absentia for much of the debate as Democrats sought to question the   by proxy. They asked whether Mr. Sessions supported Mr. Trump’s most controversial statements and questioned whether he had the independence to rein in the   Mr. Trump if he seeks to exceed his presidential authority. In his cool, Southern drawl, Mr. Sessions vowed repeatedly that he would, saying that an attorney general “cannot be a mere rubber stamp” for the president. “If an attorney general is asked to do something that’s plainly unlawful,” he said, “that person would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the attorney general believes would be unlawful or unconstitutional. ” But he indicated that he did not believe he would reach that impasse. If he advises Mr. Trump that a policy is illegal, he said, “I am confident that he would” heed that advice. A Methodist, he also pledged to set aside his personal beliefs and aggressively enforce all federal laws  —   even in areas like abortion, gay rights and hate crimes where he has made his opposition well known. “I don’t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that I didn’t vote for,” he said. “I think I can separate my personal votes of maybe years ago from what my responsibilities is today. ” He was asked, for instance, about a law he opposed in the Senate making attacks based on sexual orientation a hate crime. “The law has been passed, the Congress has spoken, and you can be sure I will enforce it,” Mr. Sessions said. Many of Mr. Sessions’s answers appeared calculated to distance himself from some of Mr. Trump’s most contentious threats and pledges on the campaign trail. He said, for instance, that current law “absolutely” bans waterboarding and the use of other torture techniques against prisoners  —   even though Mr. Trump promised to reinstitute the practice and Mr. Sessions himself supported it for years. Asked about last week’s report by intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the American election, he said that “I have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise”  —   a sharp contrast from Mr. Trump’s weeks of skepticism. Mr. Trump last week called the uproar over Russia’s role a “political witch hunt. ” He said he also opposed creating a registry of American Muslims or banning Muslim immigrants, as Mr. Trump proposed repeatedly during the campaign in response to terrorist attacks. “I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,” Mr. Sessions said. But he said he supported using “extreme vetting” of immigrants that might take into account religious beliefs  —   an idea Mr. Trump now appears to have endorsed. Mr. Sessions also appeared to play down the prospects that his Justice Department would seek to jail Hillary Clinton over her private email server, another pledge that Mr. Trump made repeatedly during the campaign. Mr. Sessions surprised lawmakers by declaring that he would recuse himself from any decisions on Mrs. Clinton’s emails or the Clinton Foundation because he said that critical statements he made about her during the campaign might pose a conflict. Mr. Sessions had previously supported appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton. The F. B. I. ’s investigation into her private email server is closed, and while a preliminary investigation into the Clinton Foundation is open, senior law enforcement officials say there is little basis for the case to move forward. He deflected questions about Mr. Trump with a calm stoicism, but he grew angry and emotional when Democrats pressed him on a more personal matter: accusations of racial insensitivity toward his employees and others as a federal prosecutor, which doomed his nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986. Protesters in the ornate Senate hearing room, who disrupted the proceedings more than a dozen times during the day, erupted in chants of “Sessions is a racist!” and “No Trump, no K. K. K. no fascist U. S. A. !” Two men dressed as Klansmen in white robes and hoods shouted their mocking support for Mr. Sessions before security officers hustled them out of the room. With his voice rising, Mr. Sessions called accusations that he had made racist remarks in the 1980s “damnably false. ” Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican friend who introduced Mr. Sessions for the hearing, came to his defense, pointing to Mr. Sessions’s prosecution of Klan members in an Alabama murder and his appointment of the first   chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee’s Republican staff. “These are not the actions of an individual motivated by racial animus,” she said. Mr. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump’s   presidential bid in early 2016, and they bonded over their shared agreement that immigration had had devastating effects on working people. While Mr. Sessions sought to distance himself on Tuesday from some of Mr. Trump’s controversial stances, he embraced the  ’s focus on toughened immigration laws and a “law and order” agenda  —   priorities he himself has stressed for years. He promised to escalate federal arrests and prosecutions of undocumented immigrants, drug dealers, gun traffickers and violent criminals in response to a rise in crime in some cities, and he declared that “protecting the American people from the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism will continue to be a top priority. ” Critical to that agenda, he said, will be improving federal relations with the police after the intense scrutiny that has followed a string of   police shootings of black men, often unarmed. “Law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors,” Mr. Sessions said. “They believe the political leadership in the country has abandoned them. ” Indeed, Mr. Sessions questioned the Obama administration’s use of civil rights lawsuits and consent decrees to force changes in training and    policies at police departments that have been accused of unconstitutional tactics. Although Mr. Sessions has completed his testimony, the hearings will continue on Wednesday with testimony by advocates on both sides. Witnesses supporting Mr. Sessions will include former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general. Testifying against him will be officials from the American Civil Liberties Union and the N. A. A. C. P. as well as Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, a rare case of a senator testifying against a colleague."
209,17521,Hearing Highlights: Sessions Questioned on Links to Xenophobia - The New York Times,New York Times,"Matt Apuzzo, Eric Lichtblau and Emmarie Huetteman",2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"■ Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama offered assurances that he would be willing as attorney general to tell   Donald J. Trump “no” and not be “a mere rubber stamp. ” ■ He said that waterboarding is “absolutely” illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the United States. ■ Because of comments he made during the presidential campaign, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any lingering investigations involving Hillary Clinton’s emails or her family’s foundation. ■ Retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee, said that a wall on the border with Mexico would not by itself remedy illegal immigration. Here’s the latest: Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, questioned Mr. Sessions about his links to groups and people who have taken xenophobic views. Here’s a quick primer, from a recent Times profile. Mr. Blumenthal asked: “How can Americans have confidence that you’re going to enforce   laws if you’ve accepted awards from these kinds of groups and associated with these kinds of individuals and won’t return the awards?” Mr. Sessions said he does not necessarily share the views of every political donor or organization he has received an award from. Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic. He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs, said he was “heartbroken” when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol, and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like Colorado that have legalized marijuana. He said in 2015: Flash forward to Tuesday. Mr. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the Justice Department behind drug prosecution in those states. Doing so would set up a huge fight over states’ rights and federal drug policy. “I know it won’t be an easy decision,” he said. Senate Democrats do not have the votes, by themselves, to prevent Mr. Sessions from becoming attorney general, and they have spared their colleague any vitriol, doing little to undermine his confirmation. Mr. Sessions was prepared to face renewed questions about race and comments he was accused of making  in the 1980s regarding the N. A. A. C. P. the American Civil Liberties Union and “ ” views. Liberal activists have repeatedly disrupted the hearing, screaming “K. K. K. ” or “racist. ” But the questioning from Democrats has mostly focused on his Senate record and whether he would enforce laws that he disagreed with. He has said he would. In short, there is no indication so far that his confirmation is in jeopardy. Mr. Sessions, who has supported the use of waterboarding as an interrogation tactic, said that current law makes it “absolutely improper and illegal. ” That’s important because it suggests that Mr. Sessions sees no workaround that would allow Mr. Trump to reinstate such tactics. Mr. Sessions has previously said he supported the Justice Department legal analysis that authorized harsh interrogation in C. I. A. prisons, and has said that waterboarding works. By saying that the law against waterboarding is clear, Mr. Sessions makes it much harder, if not impossible, for Mr. Trump to bring it back. In response to a question about whether he supported a temporary ban on Muslim immigration, as Mr. Trump has suggested, Mr. Sessions said he did not. “I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious groups should be denied admission to the United States,” he said. But he noted that Mr. Trump has since clarified that the restriction should be on immigration from countries that support terrorism. He said religious views  —   where, for example, they include justification for violence against Americans  —   should be considered as part of the visa progress. Would you support a law that says, ‘You can’t come to America because you’re a Muslim’? asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “No,” Mr. Sessions replied. Mr. Sessions was a top surrogate for Mr. Trump during a campaign in which “lock her up!” was a rallying cry against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sessions said that if there were lingering investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server or her family foundation, he would recuse himself. “You intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email matter and any investigation involving the Clinton foundation, if there are any?” asked Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. “Yes,” Mr. Sessions said. “This country doesn’t punish its political enemies. ” Mr. Sessions last faced the Judiciary Committee three decades ago, for a seat on the federal bench. His nomination failed, in part over allegations that he had described civil rights groups as “ ” and that he had suggested a white lawyer was a disgrace to his race for representing  . At the time, he said his comments were misunderstood or taken out of context. He offered a more forceful denial this time: “I never declared that the N. A. A. C. P. was ‘ ’ or that a civil rights attorney was a ‘disgrace to his race,’” Mr. Sessions said. In 1986 he described it this way: And here’s how he described the “disgrace to his race” exchange. Mr. Sessions assured his Senate colleagues that he would strictly adhere to the Constitution and stand up to the president if needed. He’s been consistent for years that senators should apply that test to Justice Department nominees. The Republican theme of the hearing is that Mr. Sessions is a known entity, and he reinforced that in his opening remarks. “You know who I am,” he said. “You know what I believe in. ” Mr. Sessions has been in the Senate for nearly 20 years and is liked by his colleagues. Moderate Republicans and at least one Democrat have said they will vote for him, which all but guarantees his confirmation. And General Kelly is likely to be easily confirmed. That does not mean Democrats will hold their fire, but they are likely to mount their most vigorous offensive against other nominees, including Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican who is Mr. Trump’s choice to be health secretary. While Mr. Sessions faced some tough questioning, the early going for General Kelly was more gentle. Mr. Gates, a former defense secretary under Mr. Obama and George W. Bush, introduced General Kelly as a “  candid, courageous leader who will say exactly what he thinks. ” But what sets him apart, Mr. Gates said, is his character. “To put it quite simply, he is one of the finest people I have ever known,” he said. “I would trust him with my life. ” Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the committee’s top Democrat, asked Mr. Kelly to be ready to take tough questions, but thanked him for providing the disclosures necessary by the Office of Government Ethics, whose review was completed this week. She asked Mr. Kelly to hew closely to what he had described as his greatest strength: speaking truth to power. “That was music to my ears,” Ms. McCaskill said. “I believe very much in that principle, and I think we all anticipate that you will need it in your next job. ” “Given your experience, I expect you to be up to that challenge,” she added. “And I think if you’re backing down, you’ll probably hear from me. ” In response to questions from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, about Mr. Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the southern border, General Kelly said a physical barrier wasn’t going to stem the problem. “If you were to build a wall from the Pacific to Mexico, you would still have to have it backed up by people, by sensors, by other technologies,” he said. The Kelly hearing was remarkable for its subdued tone, with Republicans and Democrats alike cordially asking Mr. Kelly about Mr. Trump’s more contentious stances, like forcing Muslims to register with the federal government. One by one, he put their concerns to rest in a measured tone. It apparently proved too subdued for the protest group Code Pink. A couple of activists listened in their bright pink capes mere hours after disrupting the confirmation hearing for Mr. Sessions. More than an hour after the hearing started, they quietly collected their belongings and left the hearing room without any demonstration."
210,17522,"Republicans, Facing Pressure, Delay Hearings for 4 Trump Cabinet Nominees - The New York Times",New York Times,Jennifer Steinhauer and Steve Eder,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Senate Republicans, under increasing pressure to ensure that   Donald J. Trump’s nominees are fully vetted by federal authorities, have delayed the hearings of four potential cabinet members, three of whom have not been cleared by the agency charged with unraveling potential conflicts of interest. As frustrations over confirmations grow, a group that supports Republicans accused the ethics office and its leader  —   in a highly unusual attack on the nonpartisan agency  —   of politicizing a process long viewed by both parties as arduous but essential for anyone serving in government. Hearings for Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Education Andrew Puzder, his labor secretary nominee and Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, have all been pushed back as Democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their hearings commence. Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce, will also be delayed several days because his ethics agreement is not complete, according to the chairman and ranking Democrat of the commerce committee. The delays represent a stumble for the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed to run government with a businesslike efficiency, and highlights how in several respects its preparation to take office is behind that of predecessors. In the case of Ms. DeVos, a billionaire, a complex web of financial holdings may be slowing down the Office of Government Ethics, which helps federal officials address conflict of interest matters, while Mr. Puzder’s background documents are also not in order. Walter M. Shaub Jr. the director of the ethics office, said in a letter to Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that he did not know when Ms. DeVos would be cleared by his agency as this was “dependent on the nominee to provide needed information, respond to questions and accept the terms of an ethics agreement. ” Republicans have vowed hearings for as many nominees as possible before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, so that they can be cleared to served immediately, particularly those posts associated with national security. “We will be in a position to confirm a significant number of the president’s nominees on day one,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Tuesday on the Senate floor, “This new hearing schedule is a very good first step, but we still have a ways to go. ” Mr. Trump’s aides have been pressuring the ethics office to expedite its processes, even though it did not get the necessary paperwork from most of his nominees until recently, putting Republicans in a difficult position of either pushing forward with hearings without proper vetting  —   something most of the chairmen are loath to do  —   or delaying them in some cases indefinitely. “Trump is the latest   to begin the process in contemporary history,” said Paul C. Light, a professor of Public Service at New York University who worked on Capitol Hill as an adviser on transitions. “This puts the Republicans under pressure and sets up possible problems down the road. Mr. Trump is asking the Senate to make up for his own failures here. ” The conservative organization America Rising PAC took aim at Mr. Shaub on Monday, highlighting his “history as a Democrat and the double standard he employed as head” of the agency, highlighting his political donations to President Obama as well as his office’s “utter incompetence” in policing financial matters related to Hillary and Bill Clinton. The PAC chided Mr. Shaub for wading into the politics of the transitions, saying his public comments and criticisms had become fodder for “Congressional Democrats to try and score points. ” The PAC noted an informal  —   and    —   series of postings on Twitter from the office’s official account congratulating Mr. Trump on divesting from his real estate business  —   a move he had not made. “The head of President Obama’s ethics department has absolutely zero credibility to criticize others,” Scott Sloofman, a spokesman for America Rising PAC, said in an email, adding that Mr. Shaub’s “outburst over the weekend reeks of partisan politics from an embittered Democrat still reeling from November’s election result. ” In messages posted to Twitter on Tuesday, the office wrote that it is “Moving quickly!”  —   noting that it had   54 percent of the nominees it has received from the Trump transition team, compared with 29 percent at the same point in 2009. “OGE is expediting reviews of the financial disclosure reports of the  ’s nominees, without sacrificing quality,” the agency said on Twitter. An employment lawyer by trade, Mr. Shaub joined the Office of Government Ethics in 2006, during the administration of George W. Bush, working as a supervisory lawyer. In 2008, he became a deputy general counsel, and then President Obama in 2013 nominated Mr. Shaub as director of the office. Ethics experts who have worked closely with the office and Mr. Shaub said the criticisms of him seemed unfair. “For simply doing his job, director Shaub is now being unfairly attacked,” Norman L. Eisen, a former special counsel for ethics and government reform under Mr. Obama, and Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer to Mr. Bush, said in a joint statement. “It seems that it is open season on ethics in Washington, D. C. Last week the nonpartisan, independent Office of Congressional Ethics was attacked, and now the nonpartisan, independent Office of Government Ethics and its director are being targeted. ” They added, “This attempt to bully and intimidate a hardworking, understaffed agency like O. G. E. must not go unchecked. ” The compliance office work on the transition got off to a cordial and even enthusiastic start during the final months of the campaign, and continued after the election, according to a series of emails between ethics officials and Mr. Trump’s representatives obtained through public records requests by MSNBC and the James Madison Project. “Congratulations on the campaign’s victory,” Mr. Shaub wrote members of Mr. Trump’s transition team on the morning after Election Day, just hours after his victory, adding, “We’re really looking forward to getting down to work on this presidential transition  —   which we’re going to make one of the best in history!”"
211,17523,Trump Asks Critic of Vaccines to Lead Vaccine Safety Panel - The New York Times,New York Times,"Michael D. Shear, Nicholas Fandos and Jennifer Steinhauer",2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"■ Robert F. Kennedy Jr. one of the nation’s most prominent skeptics of childhood vaccines, says   Donald J. Trump has asked him to lead a vaccine panel. ■ Charlotte Church delivers a pungent “no” to the inaugural committee’s invitation to perform. Inaugural official says they were going for “soft sensuality” anyway. ■ A delay for the confirmation hearing of Mr. Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Mr. Trump on Tuesday asked a prominent   crusader to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity, ushering debunked conspiracy theories about the dangers of immunization into the White House. Mr. Trump, who has embraced discredited links between vaccines and autism, has asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, to be chairman of the commission, Mr. Kennedy said after meeting with the   at Trump Tower. Mr. Kennedy’s appointment spread alarm through the medical community, which for years has rejected claims that childhood vaccines are linked to conditions like autism. Medical experts warned Tuesday that Mr. Trump’s actions would endanger children by confusing parents about the need to have them vaccinated. “It gives it a   that I frankly find frightening,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. He said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kennedy were being fooled by “ ” theories about vaccines. “This is going to be a sad struggle as we try to protect as many children as possible,” Mr. Schaffner said. Among his many political pursuits, Mr. Trump picked up the   cause a few years back. In 2012, he tweeted: And: These views, to say the least, are not the scientific consensus, any more than scientists believe that climate change is a Chinese plot  —   another theory once espoused by the  . Charlotte Church can sing in English, Welsh, Latin, Italian and French, but she won’t be doing so in any language for Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Ms. Church, the Welsh singer who began her public career at the age of 11 in the late 1990s, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump’s inaugural team had reached out to her about performing during the festivities. She was, to put it nicely, less than interested. (Yes, those emoji are what you think they are.) Ms. Church’s wasn’t the only door slamming shut on Mr. Trump’s team on Tuesday. The other belonged to Rebecca Ferguson, a British singer who rose to prominence on the country’s “X Factor” and said she would perform only if she could sing Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit. ” The inaugural team was apparently less than enthusiastic. Mr. Trump’s team has secured performances by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the    Jackie Evancho and the Radio City Rockettes. They are expected to dribble out more artists soon. Meh, they didn’t want Charlotte Church anyway. Tom Barrack Jr. a close friend of Mr. Trump’s who is planning the inauguration, told reporters in Trump Tower on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was not looking for “ ” to perform anyway. “We’re fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the ” Mr. Barrack said. He added, “so what we’ve done instead of trying to surround him with what people consider   is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place. It’s a much more poetic cadence than having a circuslike celebration that’s a coronation. ” “Soft sensuality” is not generally what comes to mind when one thinks of Washington, D. C. in January, but the city is changing. Senate Democrats have been complaining that there are too many hearings for Mr. Trump’s nominees on Wednesday  —   at one point there were six scheduled  —   and Republicans, eager to get Mr. Trump’s team in place, have relented a bit. They moved Betsy DeVos, his pick for education secretary, to Jan. 17. Ms. DeVos’s wealth and complicated finances have made the process of unraveling her potential conflicts of interest through the Office of Government Ethics a bit more complicated, so she was perhaps the most logical person to bump. The office, in a letter to Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, made it clear that Ms. DeVos’s background check is far from complete, and that it would be inappropriate to move forward without it. Republicans have maintained the date for her vote out of the HELP Committee: Jan. 24. Two military experts told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that an exception should be made so that James N. Mattis, a recently retired Marine Corps general, can serve as secretary of defense in the Trump administration. The hearing on the importance of civilian control of the military, which was led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, is intended to set the stage for the committee’s confirmation hearing on Mr. Mattis’s nomination on Thursday. Military officers are barred by law from serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of office for seven years. Mr. Mattis retired from the military in May 2013. But in an encouraging sign for his prospects, the lawmakers appeared to be generally receptive to the experts’ arguments. “The principle of civilian control of the military is precious,” said Eliot A. Cohen, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, who served as State Department counselor during the George W. Bush administration. But Mr. Cohen, who was a “Never Trumper” during the campaign, argued that an exception should be made because Mr. Mattis was a person of integrity and had vital experience at a time when the Pentagon has to contend with multiple threats, and because he might dissuade the incoming administration from acting recklessly. “A Secretary Mattis would be a stabilizing and moderating force, preventing wildly stupid, dangerous and illegal things from happening, and over time helping to steer American foreign and security policy in a sound and sensible direction,” Mr. Cohen said. Kathleen H. Hicks, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also said that it was appropriate to make an exception for Mr. Mattis and praised his character and expertise. “It should never be considered ‘time for a general’ to fill the   nonelected civilian position in the operational chain,” she said, referring to Mr. Trump’s comments in a November interview. “I assess the state of U. S.   relations to be strong enough to withstand any risk such a     exception, on its own, could pose,” she added.   Trump’s transition team is considering asking the deputy defense secretary, Robert Work, to remain in his position at the Pentagon for several months after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, according to an official familiar with the discussions. While no final decision has been made, the official suggested that Mr. Work could provide some initial bureaucratic stability as Mr. Mattis builds his team at the Pentagon. Last month Mr. Trump announced his intention to nominate Vincent Viola as Army secretary. Mr. Work’s consideration was posted on Twitter by Jennifer Griffin of Fox News and also reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Work could not be reached for comment Monday night. This one will hurt. Two prominent   lawmakers, Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, will be the Democrats’ star witnesses against Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be attorney general. Mr. Sessions’s nomination to be a federal judge in 1986 was derailed by allegations of racial bias, and he has drawn opposition from   groups. Both lawmakers will have their own particular resonance. Mr. Lewis, a lieutenant of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s, was beaten bloody on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. a seminal moment in the civil rights movement. Mr. Booker, the former mayor of Newark, may lack the historical gravitas of Mr. Lewis, but he may hold more weight for one reason: He will be testifying against a fellow senator. He is believed to be the first sitting senator set to testify against a fellow sitting senator  —   ever. In a large show of military opposition to reinstating torture, 176 retired officers  —   including 33   generals and admirals  —   have sent a joint letter to Mr. Trump urging him not to follow through on his campaign vows to bring back waterboarding “and a hell of a lot worse. ” The letter, obtained by The New York Times, was dated Jan. 6 and signed by some of the most prominent military figures of the recent era. They included two former Afghanistan war commanders, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and Gen. John R. Allen, and the Special Operations commander who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Adm. William H. McRaven. Citing their “six thousand years of combined experience” in commanding troops, the retired officers expressed concern “about statements made during the campaign about the use of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees in U. S. custody,” and they noted that waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques” are illegal under domestic and international law. The officers also called torture both “unnecessary” and “counterproductive,” adding that it “violates our core values as a nation. ” “Our greatest strength is our commitment to the rule of law and to the principles embedded in our Constitution,” the letter continued. “Our servicemen and women need to know that our leaders do not condone torture or detainee abuse of any kind. ” During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would bring back waterboarding and more for the interrogation of terrorism suspects  —   contending that “torture works,” and even “if it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway. ” The letter makes clear that Mr. Mattis, Mr. Trump’s pick for defense secretary, is not alone in recoiling against torture. Those signing also included a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Hugh H. Shelton a former commander of the Central Command, Gen. Joseph Hoar and four former commanders of the Southern Command: Gen. Douglas Fraser, Gen. James T. Hill, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey and Adm. James G. Stavridis, who went on to be the NATO supreme allied commander. The list also included two former directors of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander and Adm. Bobby Ray Inman a commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles C. Krulak and chiefs of staff of the Army and the Air Force, Gen. Dennis J. Reimer and Gen. Merrill A. McPeak. In public, President Obama and his top officials have been careful to keep the smiles pasted on their faces when it comes to their successors, but Michael Froman, Mr. Obama’s United States trade representative, will let the smile slip this morning in a speech billed as a “farewell address. ” In prepared remarks, Mr. Froman does not mention Mr. Trump by name, but he leaves little doubt that he disdains the incoming president’s views on trade, particularly Mr. Trump’s opposition to a proposed trade agreement among Pacific Rim nations that Mr. Froman labored on for years. “I can’t imagine why any president would want to abdicate our leadership in the   to be responsible for handing the keys of the castle to China, for driving our historic allies and China’s historic rivals into China’s arms,” Mr. Froman’s prepared text reads. Mr. Froman describes Mr. Trump’s opposition to the deal, the central achievement of Mr. Froman’s tenure as United States trade representative, as “the biggest gift any U. S. president could give China. ”"

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama delivered a nostalgic but hopeful farewell address to the nation from a convention center in Chicago. He warned the nation not to shrink from the challenges of economic inequality, racial strife, political isolation and voter apathy. “If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing,” Mr. Obama, a   political organizer, told the cheering crowd. “If you’re disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Persevere. ” Here’s the full video and text. _____ 2. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama,   Donald J. Trump’s pick for attorney general, received a surprisingly gentle welcome at the start of his Senate confirmation hearing. He appeared to assuage Democrats by saying that that waterboarding is “absolutely” illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the United States, and even the most liberal senators declined to vigorously confront him on allegations of racism from three decades ago. The whirlwind week of hearings continued with retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee. Here’s the full schedule for the week. And late in the day came this news: The chiefs of America’s intelligence agencies last week gave Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama a summary of unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. Trump. The agencies are investigating, said two officials with knowledge of the matter. _____ 3. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who expressed no remorse for killing nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, S. C. was sentenced to death. The jury returned its unanimous verdict after about three hours of deliberations in the penalty phase of the trial. Mr. Roof showed no emotion as the verdict was read. _____ 4. The Obama administration is making a   push for police overhauls in two of the nation’s most violent cities, where officers have been accused of routinely mistreating  . The results of the Justice Department’s sweeping investigation into police practices in Chicago are expected before Inauguration Day. Baltimore, above, is close to a deal that would require the police to make changes under court supervision. _____ 5. Fox News secretly settled sexual harassment accusations against Bill O’Reilly, the network’s top host, last summer. Juliet Huddy, a longtime   personality, said Mr. O’Reilly had tried to ruin her career after she rebuffed his advances. The settlement was described in a draft of a letter from Ms. Huddy’s lawyers to Fox News that was mailed anonymously to The Times and verified. _____ 6. Volkswagen is on the verge of admitting to criminal violations and paying $4. 3 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its cheating on emissions tests. The company will probably plead guilty to charges of customs fraud and violating the Clean Air Act, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. _____ 7. Protests broke out in Iran at the funeral of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a key figure in the country’s 1979 revolution who had come to be seen as the last establishment voice friendly to the opposition. Officials said 2. 5 million mourners attended. The live broadcast on state television tried to avoid protesters’ chants for a former presidential candidate under house arrest against Russia, Iran’s ally in the Syrian conflict and for the release of political prisoners. _____ 8. Clare Hollingworth, a British journalist who became the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, died in Hong Kong at 105. She was on the   border in August 1939, just a week into her first job for a British newspaper, when she reported what was probably the greatest scoop of modern times: the start of World War II. She roamed the conflict zones of the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver. _____ 9. “They started coming in like the tide. ” That was an official at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar have fled by the thousands to escape a brutal counterinsurgency campaign. They say soldiers burned their villages, shot at random and systematically raped women and girls. _____ 10. Finally, a wealthy activist who bought a $2. 2 million West Village home a decade ago is giving it to the original Manhattanites: the Lenape Native American nation.   Goldwater Bourgeois, the son of the sculptor Louise Bourgeois, said he had always been troubled by the    legend that the Lenape sold Manhattan (the name is their word for “the land of many hills”) to Dutch settlers for the equivalent of $24 worth of goods. “Manhattan is a capitalist rock this is a quiet protest against that,” he said. “I’m giving it back to whom the land was stolen from, and that’s really a joyful event. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

Trump’s first news conference since July. _____ • American intelligence agencies presented President Obama and   Trump with unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious information about Mr. Trump.

Those in the camp say soldiers burned their villages, shot at random and systematically raped women and girls. _____ • In Iran, the authorities ignored the opposition chants that erupted at the sprawling state funeral for Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who died on Sunday. Mr. Rafsanjani, once a staunch conservative, had in recent years become a hero to Iran’s middle class. For many of those involved in the   Green Revolution, the antigovernment demonstrations in 2009, he was a lone establishment voice representing their beliefs. By official estimates, 2. 5 million people attended the funeral. _____ • Beijing has increasingly signaled that it wants to take on a leadership role in promoting the Paris agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

If the plan succeeds, it could be the beginning of a change in how we listen to radio around the globe. Switzerland, Britain and Denmark are considering the same move. Norway, where terrestrial radio remains quite popular, was among the first countries to adopt digital radio in the 1990s. The government’s current effort is aimed at improving audio quality. That was also a goal in the creation of FM radio, which offers staticless,   broadcasting. Edwin Armstrong, an American inventor, is credited with figuring out how to transmit sound by modulating the frequency of electromagnetic waves (FM) instead of their amplitude (AM). He later built his own FM station to prove its worth to skeptics, though his triumph was marred by legal battles over patents. The New York Times called Armstrong one of the “great inventive geniuses in electrical engineering” after his death in 1954. “He always preferred to be the master of his own laboratory.

214,17526,California Today: $8 Million in Tech Money for the Bay Area Arts - The New York Times,New York Times,Mike McPhate,2017-01-10,2017.0,1.0,,"Good morning.  (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, for today’s introduction. The titans of Silicon Valley like to claim that they’re inventing technology to change the world, and their philanthropic efforts often mirror those big global goals and dreams, with initiatives to end hunger and fight diseases. But the arts in San Francisco haven’t always felt their generosity. Even as total philanthropic spending in the Bay Area has more than doubled over the past decade to around $5 billion, according to the Foundation Center, it’s been difficult for some arts groups to find support with so many organizations competing for attention and funding. Last year, for example, with social inequality such a   issue, one heavyweight charitable organization, the James Irvine Foundation, chose to stop spending on the arts and switch all of its future giving toward addressing poverty. The move has important repercussions: In 2015 the Irvine Foundation gave $15. 45 million to the arts, more than a fifth of the foundation’s total grants. So on Tuesday culture fans were given a reason to cheer when the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation announced a plan to spend $8 million on performing arts projects in the Bay Area over the next five years. A panel of experts convened by the foundation will help select 50 works from artists in the Bay Area. The performances will include dance, theater, music and performance art. “There’s much more of a demand for arts than we can hope to fulfill,” said Larry Kramer, the president of the foundation, which gets its funding from the fortune made from one of the founders of   the pioneering computer company. “It’s hard to raise money for the arts,” said Ben Mangan, the executive director of the Center for Social Sector Leadership at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “The arts don’t fall neatly into a category of a problem to solve. ” Giving money away is fraught with difficult choices, Mr. Kramer said. “The thing about philanthropy is that there are a million problems that are worth addressing and you can’t address all of them,” he said.

The project is the brainchild of Nathaniel Miller, an interactivity editor at The Sacramento Bee. In an interview, Mr. Miller said he used his free time outside of work to research the murals over much of 2016. He portrayed himself as an art novice who was simply in the mood for a project that he thought would be of use. The murals range from the handiwork of elementary school children to interpretations by established artists. All told, Mr. Miller cataloged 420 murals, but he expects that number to grow. Sacramento officials have been embracing public art as a way to enliven the city. During the Sacramento Mural Festival last August, artists were invited to bring blank walls to life at about a dozen places across the city center. Some of the works stretched several stories high.

215,17527,Sentenced to Death: A Look at Dylann Roof’s Rampage and Its Aftermath - The New York Times,New York Times,Richard Pérez-Peña,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"Update: A federal jury has unanimously sentenced Dylann S. Roof to die. The white supremacist showed no remorse for killing nine members of a black church in South Carolina. Read more » • Mr. Roof, a white supremacist with no known ties to any organized group, was convicted of the   assault on Dec. 15 by the same federal jury. • Mr. Roof’s guilt was never in question in the trial, and the jury deliberated for about three hours before assessing the death penalty. • Judge Richard M. Gergel has scheduled a formal sentencing hearing for Wednesday at 9:30 a. m. “We want to express our sympathy to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof’s actions. Today’s sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy. ” “We are Dylann Roof’s family. We will always love Dylann. We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people. We wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt. We continue to pray for the Emanuel A. M. E. families and the Charleston community. ” “No verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel. And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof’s callous hand. But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston  —   and the people of our nation  —   with a measure of closure. ” On the evening of Wednesday, June 17, 2015, Mr. Roof, a    white man, walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C. and asked for the pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney. Mr. Roof was directed to a Bible study session, where he sat down next to the pastor, and for nearly an hour, listened and took part in the discussion. Mr. Roof then pulled out a .  Glock semiautomatic pistol, loaded with   bullets, and according to witnesses, told the minister and parishioners, “You are raping our women and taking over our country. ” He shot and killed nine people, including Mr. Pinckney, before fleeing the church. He shot each victim multiple times, reloading his gun several times. Mr. Roof told investigators and friends that he had hoped to start a race war. He complained of what he saw as black corruption and takeover of the United States and what he said was an epidemic of    crime. He owned a website that included an essay on his belief in the danger and inferiority of blacks and the value of segregation. In the essay, Mr. Roof, a   dropout with few friends and no steady work, also gave his reasons for the attack: “We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me. ” The gunman could not have chosen a target more laden with symbolism about the nation’s tortured racial history, and he apparently knew it, singling out the church for that reason. Emanuel A. M. E. lies in the historic heart of Charleston, the capital of the slave trade in the United States, the cradle of the Confederacy and the place where the first shots of the Civil War were fired. The church, known as Mother Emanuel, occupies a place of pride in southern black history it is one of the oldest black congregations in the South, dating back two centuries. Many people were shaken because the shooting happened in a place of sanctuary and because of who the victims were: nine people who were described as gentle and deeply religious. Three of them were over age 70, and four were pastors. At Mr. Roof’s first court appearance a few days later, victims’ family members stunned and moved millions of Americans by speaking of forgiveness and redemption, rather than anger and vengeance. Black churches have been frequent targets of racist attacks for generations, and for people old enough to remember, the shooting carried reminders of the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Ala. that killed four black girls. One of the Charleston dead, Mr. Pinckney, 41, was also a Democratic state senator and a leader of South Carolina’s black community whose warmth won him friends even among political adversaries. At his funeral, President Obama gave the eulogy, an impassioned plea to recognize and oppose prejudice, saying, “For too long, we’ve been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. ” After decades of debate, a Confederate battle flag was removed from the grounds of South Carolina’s state Capitol with remarkable swiftness, lowered for good less than a month after the shooting, following an emotional debate in the Legislature. In previous fights over the flag, white conservatives defended it staunchly, but this time, conservative Republicans like Gov. Nikki Haley, Senator Lindsey Graham and State Senator Paul Thurmond  —   son of the United States senator and onetime segregationist champion Strom Thurmond  —   publicly opposed the flag, sealing its fate. But calls for stricter gun controls, including tighter background checks for buying weapons, fell flat. Under federal law, Mr. Roof’s record of drug abuse might have barred him from buying the gun he used, but the balky background check system failed to produce the needed information within three days, so he was able to go ahead with the purchase. Mr. Roof confessed to investigators soon after he was arrested, and more recently, he offered to plead guilty in return for a sentence of life in prison. But federal prosecutors decided to go to trial and seek the death penalty. At his trial last month, his lawyers conceded that he had committed the attack. A jury found him guilty of all 33 counts against him, including hate crimes resulting in death. The case then moved to the penalty phase, to determine whether Mr. Roof should be executed. (If he had not been sentenced to die, he could have still faced capital punishment in state court.) Acting as his own lawyer in the penalty phase, Mr. Roof declined to present any defense, and he refused any argument or evidence suggesting mental illness. In a journal he kept before the shooting, he had written: “I am morally opposed to psychology. It is a Jewish invention. ” The vast majority of capital sentences and executions stem from state courts, not federal. Of about 2, 900 people on death rows in the United States, just 68 face sentences meted out by federal courts, including six by military courts. The federal inmates under death sentences include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 and Nidal Hasan, who committed the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. When Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, was executed in 2001, he was the first federal inmate put to death in 38 years. There have been just two federal executions since then  —   in 2001 and 2003. It would be hard to find another crime where the toll was as high, the victims were as sympathetic, the premeditation was as evident and the defendant’s guilt was as  . But Mr. Roof’s case has prompted a   debate over whether he should be put to death. Some commentators and editorial boards have argued that a crime of this magnitude cries out for execution. Even some with doubts about how the death penalty is used say that if capital punishment is to continue, Mr. Roof warrants it. Death penalty opponents agree that if any defendant deserves the ultimate punishment, it is Mr. Roof, but they insist that the case against capital punishment should still outweigh the anger and revulsion over any particular case. They argue that its use has been wildly inconsistent and even arbitrary, and exonerations of convicted inmates show that the risk of putting an innocent person to death is high. A twist in this case is that a common argument against the death penalty is that it is more likely to be used when the victims are white and the accused are black  —   the reverse of the circumstances in the Charleston shooting. Another is that even some family members of those who were murdered have spoken out against executing Mr. Roof. Much less common than it used to be. States carried out 20 executions last year, the lowest figure in 25 years. Courts handed down just 30 new death sentences, down from more than 300 in 1996, the lowest figure since the early 1970s."

Schmidt,2017-01-23,2017.0,1.0,,"In the weeks after Roger Ailes was ousted as the chairman of Fox News in July amid a sexual harassment scandal, company executives secretly struck an agreement with a longtime broadcast personality who had come forward with similar accusations about the network’s top host, Bill O’Reilly. The employee, Juliet Huddy, had said that Mr. O’Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011, at a time he exerted significant influence over her career. When she rebuffed his advances, he tried to derail her career, according to a draft of a letter from her lawyers to Fox News that was obtained by The New York Times. The letter includes allegations that Mr. O’Reilly had called Ms. Huddy repeatedly and that it sometimes sounded as if he was masturbating. He invited her to his house on Long Island, tried to kiss her, took her to dinner and the theater, and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room, appeared at the door in his boxer shorts, according to the letter. In exchange for her silence and agreement not to sue, she was paid a sum in the high six figures, according to people briefed on the agreement. The agreement was between Ms. Huddy, 47, and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News. The company and Mr. O’Reilly’s lawyer said her allegations were false. In the aftermath of Mr. Ailes’s departure, executives declared that such behavior would never again be tolerated. Mr. O’Reilly, 67, has continued to host his show on weekdays at 8 p. m. and has published two more books. Details about the allegations and the agreement between Ms. Huddy and 21st Century Fox are based on interviews with current and former Fox News employees, the letter written by her lawyers to the company, and three pages from the draft of the settlement agreement. The letter was mailed anonymously in December to reporters for The Times its authenticity was verified by several people who have been briefed on it. A person close to Ms. Huddy told The Times that she shared accounts of Mr. O’Reilly’s unwanted advances at the time they occurred. Lawnewz. com first reported the existence of the agreement Monday afternoon. In the letter, lawyers for Ms. Huddy also said that a longtime Fox executive, Jack Abernethy, had retaliated against her professionally after she made clear that she was not interested in a personal relationship. Representatives for Fox News and Mr. O’Reilly dismissed the allegations Monday night. “The letter contains substantial falsehoods, which both men have vehemently denied,” Irena Briganti, a spokeswoman for Fox News, said in a statement. Speaking for Mr. O’Reilly, Fredric S. Newman, his lawyer, said, “There is absolutely no basis for any claim of sexual harassment against Bill O’Reilly by Juliet Huddy. ” Jeanne M. Christensen, a lawyer for Ms. Huddy at Wigdor L. L. P. declined to comment. Ms. Huddy made her allegations known to Fox News in the letter her lawyers sent to the network in August. The settlement was reached on Sept. 5, at a time when the company was completing other agreements, including one with Gretchen Carlson, the former anchor whose sexual harassment suit forced the departure of Mr. Ailes. (Mr. Ailes has denied allegations of sexual harassment.) The company has not reached an agreement with Andrea Tantaros, another TV personality who raised similar complaints about network executives. About a month before Mr. Ailes resigned, Fox News offered Ms. Tantaros nearly $1 million for her silence and a promise not to sue the network, its executives or its employees, including Mr. O’Reilly, according to a draft of a proposed agreement. Ms. Tantaros rejected the offer and filed suit against the company in August. Mr. O’Reilly has a towering presence at Fox News. He was close to Mr. Ailes, and his show generated about $180 million in advertising in 2015, according to Kantar Media, an   firm. He was also viewed by   employees and program hosts as an influential figure in the newsroom he was the gatekeeper to time on his show, and his support could be crucial to advancement. But Mr. O’Reilly had run into problems before. In 2004, a producer on his show, Andrea Mackris, sued him, asserting that he had made unwanted sexual advances and lewd comments in a series of phone calls and dinner conversations. According to the suit, Mr. O’Reilly told her on multiple occasions to buy a vibrator, called her when it sounded as if he was masturbating, and described various sexual fantasies. After two weeks of sensational headlines in New York’s tabloid newspapers, Mr. O’Reilly settled for millions of dollars, according to people briefed on the agreement. Both sides said that no wrongdoing had occurred. According to the letter in Ms. Huddy’s case, her lawyers said that Mr. O’Reilly began sexually harassing her in 2011. She started her career at Fox News in 1998 as a reporter based in Miami and went on to be a host of a syndicated morning show in New York that was canceled in 2009. In the months afterward, Ms. Huddy tried to find a landing place at the network and appeared as a guest on Mr. O’Reilly’s show. Ms. Huddy’s father, John Huddy Sr. who was a confidant of Mr. Ailes and a consultant to Fox News, left the network in July. Her brother, John Huddy Jr. continues to work there as a correspondent based in Jerusalem. In January 2011, Mr. O’Reilly invited Ms. Huddy to lunch near his   home in Manhasset on Long Island, according to the letter. After lunch, he drove her back to his home, where he showed her every room, including his bedroom, and his collection of presidential memorabilia. “To shock and disgust, as Ms. Huddy was saying goodbye to Mr. O’Reilly, he quickly moved in and kissed her on the lips,” the letter said. “Ms. Huddy was so taken aback and repulsed that she instinctively recoiled and actually fell to the ground. Mr. O’Reilly, looking amused, did not even help Ms. Huddy up. ” The next week, Mr. O’Reilly asked her to join him for dinner at the Harvard Club, followed by a Broadway show, according to the letter and to current and former Fox News employees. Ms. Huddy was not interested in having a romantic relationship with Mr. O’Reilly but, the letter said, “she felt compelled to comply with Mr. O’Reilly’s request, given that he had total control over her work assignment. ” During the Broadway show, according to the letter, Mr. O’Reilly moved close to Ms. Huddy in a way that made her feel uncomfortable. He tried to hold her hand, but she pulled it away. Then he dropped a key to the room at a Midtown Manhattan hotel he was staying at into her lap, and told her to meet him there after the show. He stood up and left, the letter said. Ms. Huddy went to the hotel to return Mr. O’Reilly’s key, according to the letter. She asked him to meet her in the lobby, but he refused and asked her to join him in his room. “Ms. Huddy declined and explained that she was not interested in Mr. O’Reilly on a personal or sexual level,” the letter said. Mr. O’Reilly persisted and again asked that Ms. Huddy come up to his room, and she ultimately went up to give him the key, according to the letter. When Mr. O’Reilly opened the door to his room, he was wearing only boxer shorts, according to the letter. Ms. Huddy was “very embarrassed, handed Mr. O’Reilly his key and quickly left,” the letter said. In the months after Mr. O’Reilly and Ms. Huddy went to the show in Manhattan, his “obsession with her only escalated,” the letter said. Mr. O’Reilly started calling Ms. Huddy at all hours, even while he was on vacation. At times, the calls were about work, but they were sometimes “highly inappropriate and sexual,” the letter said. On some occasions, it sounded as if Mr. O’Reilly was masturbating, the letter said. “Disgusted, Ms. Huddy came up with an excuse and hung up the phone,” the letter said. As Mr. O’Reilly’s pursuit continued, Ms. Huddy answered and returned fewer of his calls. “Ms. Huddy’s rejection of Mr. O’Reilly apparently did not sit well with him, as he began to retaliate against her both on and off air,” the letter said. Mr. O’Reilly “nitpicked her work” and would “berate Ms. Huddy for minor mistakes,” according to the letter. Mr. O’Reilly stopped preparing her for segments and would surprise her with story angles that they had not discussed. In 2013, Ms. Huddy was replaced on one segment of his show. Another segment that she was featured in, called “Mad as Hell,” was canceled. She did not complain, fearing retaliation, she told current and former Fox News employees at the time. The letter also included a series of accusations by Ms. Huddy against Mr. Abernethy, including that he started “trashing her” after she rejected his attempts to pursue a personal relationship. Mr. Abernethy signed a new multiyear contract with Fox News in September, after having been named a president of the network in August. At the time, the company was aware of the allegations against Mr. Abernethy, which it has said are false. As part of Ms. Huddy’s confidential agreement with 21st Century Fox, she agreed not to “disparage, malign or defame” the parties the company, on its behalf and on the behalf of Mr. O’Reilly and Mr. Abernethy, agreed not to “disparage, malign or defame” Ms. Huddy. The consequences for breaking confidentiality are severe, costing either side $500, 000 per infringement, according to the document. Ms. Huddy is also liable if her lawyers or a person close to her discloses the terms of the agreement. On Sept. 7, Ms. Huddy, who had hosted “Good Day Early Call” on WNYW, a Fox affiliate, went on the station and gave a tearful goodbye. “Thank you to everyone who has made the last 20 years the most challenging but best of my life,” she said. “Perhaps someday, even someday soon, you’ll see me on television again. ”"
217,17530,The Art of Flavor at Flora Bar in the Met Breuer - The New York Times,New York Times,Pete Wells,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"I’m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos’s food is so good. I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant, now closed, dabbled in “deep, surrealist weirdness. ” At Estela, the place on Houston Street that put him on the map, I described his food as “almost familiar, but not quite. ” What struck me at his most recent restaurant, Café Altro Paradiso, was “the inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness. ” (What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious.) In retrospect, nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling. I latched on to visual style because I couldn’t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did. After spending some time at Flora Bar, which Mr. Mattos opened in October, I’ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can’t see. It’s a kind of cooking that’s almost invisible. Flora Bar is inside the Met Breuer museum, Marcel Breuer’s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70s, regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style. “The taste for its disconcertingly   inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly,” the architecture critic for The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote in 1966, “like a taste for olives or warm beer. ” The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer. Under the direction of Jake Nemmers, the executive chef, it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares. The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined, which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere. A simple red disc on a white plate, Flora Bar’s tuna tartare isn’t like any I’ve had before it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots, neither of which hides the clean, cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna. Flora Bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way Estela reinvents beef tartare, but it comes closer than you’d think was possible. Steak comes with béarnaise and beet hunks. The beets look a little wrinkled, like prunes, and have an uncannily focused flavor. The béarnaise is silky and light on the herbs. The steak looks like steak, sliced. It is tender, and the flavor goes on and on as you chew, yet it doesn’t have the   stink of   beef. Something must have happened to make it so extraordinary, but the answer is not visible. (The beef has been given, among other treatments, a surreptitious marination in fish sauce.) How can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises? Well, there’s the price, $29, which may be a record. But then there’s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves, glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles. They’re terrific, and so is their dark, uncloying cocktail sauce. Note the name. Flora Bar is, when you get down to it, less a restaurant than a wine bar. The plates are almost all small even the steak, which could pass as a main course, is a far cry from a steakhouse portion. Flora Bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in Kerry James Marshall’s show upstairs and now want a cheap, filling meal. That job goes to Flora Coffee next door, where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day. The wine list at Flora Bar is about as exhaustive as any artist’s career retrospective. It contains multitudes, and in three visits, I barely scratched the surface. And I left the shelves and shelves of tempting, knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched, apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing Tuxedo No. 2 cocktail. As wine bars go, it’s somewhat stiff. The service can be punctilious in a way that I imagine is meant to appeal to the Upper East Sider, but fans of Estela (and there are many Upper East Siders in that group) may find it slightly  . Or Mr. Mattos and his business partner, Thomas Carter, may just be trying to live up to the space. It’s an exceptionally dramatic one, with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on Breuer’s bridge across the moat below Madison Avenue. A sculpture garden when this building still housed the Whitney Museum of American Art, the moat is now an outdoor extension for Flora Bar. I miss the art, but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up. The menu is part tapas, part sashimi and part something else. On the tapas side, we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette, pink shavings of jamón Ibérico, and a plate of anchovies, three cured in oil and three in brine. The quality is impeccable if you can get over paying $18 for six anchovies. I couldn’t. Representing sashimi, there is shimmering raw seafood, some of it on or under squares of nori. You’re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla. A month ago, the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste, and I was quietly happy. When I went back, the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin, and I went completely giddy. It took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish, the lobster crudo. Raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with. Here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc, ready to be swabbed in a   mayonnaise. It’s refined and almost comforting. As for something else, you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin, buttery tart shell, or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc, inverted on to the plate   down, and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar, firm trout roe and crème fraîche. There’s a fine line between simple and dull, and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side. Stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias. Halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts, although they were very good parts. Natasha Pickowicz’s desserts sound safe but can be daring. Mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight. After the initial shock, I loved it. If I’d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass, like other parfaits, I was wrong. This was   chocolate, as dense as ganache, and served in the shape of, you guessed it, a disc."
218,17531,Bombings Near Afghanistan’s Parliament Kill Dozens on Day of Assaults - The New York Times,New York Times,Mujib Mashal and Taimoor Shah,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0,,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   A double bombing by the Taliban near the Afghan Parliament office compound in Kabul on Tuesday killed dozens of people during the   rush hour, officials said. The assault in the Afghan capital was the deadliest of several   attacks on Tuesday, including an explosion at a government guesthouse in the southern province of Kandahar that wounded the provincial governor and the visiting ambassador of the United Arab Emirates. Wahidullah Majrooh, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry, said 80 injured people and 30 bodies were taken to Kabul hospitals. Many officials feared that the number of casualties would rise. The Taliban issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Parliament bombings. One witness who was inside the compound said the attack started when a suicide bomber detonated explosives nearby. Then, as security forces gathered in the area a few minutes later, a car bomb detonated on the busy road that passes in front of the compound, the witness said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. An Afghan lawmaker, Kamal Safi, said meetings were underway in the compound when the attack took place, including one about the national budget. “The explosions took place exactly at the time when government employees were going home, so it was a rush hour,” Mr. Safi said. “More than a thousand people are working there, so I know the number of casualties are very high. ” An officer named Mirwais who was among those providing security for the Parliament building said most of the casualties came from a public bus that was passing by the compound when the car bomb exploded. “It was 4 p. m. and the workers were leaving  —   they either had private cars or were walking out to the main road for public transport,” Mr. Mirwais said. “The second attack happened on the main road by the gate, and that caused a lot of casualties. ” Violent attacks in Afghanistan have not subsided this year despite the harsh winter, with Taliban assaults reported on a daily basis across several provinces in the north and the south. The deteriorating situation in the south, in particular, prompted the dispatch of about 200 NATO military advisers to Farah Province. And in Helmand Province, where American and British troops struggled for years to loosen the Taliban’s grip at the height of the war, 300 United States Marines will return to help hold the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, against the insurgents. The attacks in Kabul came hours after a Taliban bomber targeted a meeting of militia commanders in Lashkar Gah, killing seven to 11 people, according to various Afghan officials. The target of that attack revealed the chaotic reality of the province that has been slipping from the hands of the Afghan government: The bombing hit the house of Hajji Khudaidad, a Taliban commander who had recently switched sides to lead a clandestine government force, essentially a duplicate Taliban, to infiltrate insurgency lines, Afghan officials said. Col. Gulai Khan, the security chief of the province, said a meeting was underway at Mr. Khudaidad’s house in the city’s Second Precinct when the attack happened. “The suicide bomber parked his vehicle laden with explosive nearby the house and walked to the house, where he shot the watchman who was on duty, and later he blew up his explosives inside,” Colonel Khan said. He said that seven people were killed and three were wounded, and that a bomb squad was trying to clear the vehicle. Other accounts suggested the attacker might have thrown grenades inside and managed to flee before he was tracked down by the police. Abdul Karim Attal, head of the Helmand provincial council, however, put the number of dead at 11. Among the wounded, officials said, were Mr. Khudaidad and Mullah Ibrahim, a senior commander of a Taliban breakaway faction that is believed to have close ties with the government. Many officials in Helmand said the effort to create the militia was being led by Abdul Jabar Qahraman, President Ashraf Ghani’s special envoy to the province, who used similar militia tactics in the 1980s on behalf of the collapsing communist government at the time. Mr. Qahraman, in an interview, admitted that he was behind creating such a “secret force” but denied that the group targeted today was part of it. It amounts to a desperate attempt to break some of the Taliban’s momentum  —   the insurgents largely control six districts of the province, the government controls two, and another six are contested, according to Bashir Ahmad Shakir, the head of the security committee at the Helmand provincial council. Details about the attack at the governor’s guesthouse in Kandahar remained scant. Officials said the governor, Humayoon Azizi, was meeting with the visiting ambassador of United Arab Emirates for an evening reception when explosions went off. Gen. Abdul Raziq, the police chief of Kandahar Province, said bombs had been placed in couches in the governor’s house. “Eleven people have been killed and around 12 have been injured, including the governor and the U. A. E. ambassador, but their conditions are not ” General Raziq said. “The bodies of the dead are badly burned and beyond recognition. ”"
219,17532,A Gut Makeover for the New Year - The New York Times,New York Times,Roni Caryn Rabin,2017-01-03,2017.0,1.0,,"If you’re making resolutions for a healthier new year, consider a gut makeover. Refashioning the community of bacteria and other microbes living in your intestinal tract, collectively known as the gut microbiome, could be a good   investment in your health. Trillions of microbial cells inhabit the human body, outnumbering human cells by 10 to one according to some estimates, and growing evidence suggests that the rich array of intestinal microbiota helps us process nutrients in the foods we eat, bolsters the immune system and does all sorts of odd jobs that promote sound health. A diminished microbial ecosystem, on the other hand, is believed to have consequences that extend far beyond the intestinal tract, affecting everything from allergies and inflammation, metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, even mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Much of the composition of the microbiome is established early in life, shaped by forces like your genetics and whether you were   or  . Microbial diversity may be further undermined by the typical   American diet, rich in sugar, meats and processed foods. But a new study in mice and people adds to evidence that suggests you can take steps to enrich your gut microbiota. Changing your diet to one containing a variety of   foods, the new research suggests, may be crucial to achieving a healthier microbiome. Altering your microbiome, however, may not be easy, and nobody knows how long it might take. That’s because the ecosystem already established in your gut determines how it absorbs and processes nutrients. So if the microbial community in your gut has been shaped by a daily diet of cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizza, for example, it won’t respond as quickly to a healthy diet as a gut shaped by vegetables and fruits that has more varied microbiota to begin with. “The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food,” said Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, the senior author of the new paper and director of the Center for Genome Science and Systems Biology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Nutritional components of a healthy diet have to be viewed from “the inside out,” he said, “not just the outside in. ” One of the questions the study set out to answer was how individuals with different diets respond when they try to improve their eating habits. The scientists harvested gut bacteria from humans, transplanted them into mice bred under sterile conditions, and then fed the mice either   or   diets. The scientists then analyzed changes in the mice’s microbial communities. Of interest, the scientists harvested the gut bacteria from people who followed sharply different diets. One group ate a fairly typical American diet, consuming about 3, 000 calories a day, high in animal proteins with few fruits and vegetables. Some of their favorite foods were processed cheese, pepperoni and lunch meats. The other group consisted of people who were devotees of calorie restriction. They ate less than 1, 800 calories a day and had meticulously tracked what they ate for at least two years, sticking to a mostly   diet and consuming far less animal protein than the other group, a third fewer carbohydrates and only half the fat. This   group, the researchers found, had a far richer and more diverse microbial community in the gut than those eating a typical American diet. They also carried several strains of “good” bacteria, known to promote health, that are unique to their   diet. “Their choices as adults dramatically influenced their gut community,” said Nicholas W. Griffin of Washington University, the paper’s lead author. The study, published in Cell Host  Microbe, is not the first to report findings suggesting dietary shifts can induce persistent changes in a gut microbial community, said Dr. David A. Relman, a professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, who was not involved in the current research. He noted that other studies had found even more profound effects. After the human microbiota was transplanted into the mice, the mice got to eat either like typical Americans or like the calorie restrictors. Mice that had a microbiota conditioned by the typical American diet had a weaker response to the   diet. Their microbial communities didn’t increase and diversify as much. “They all responded in a predictable direction, but with not as great a magnitude,” said Dr. Griffin. Another aspect of the study suggests the company you keep may also enrich your gut microbiota  —   at least in mice. At first the animals were kept in separate cages. Then, when they were housed together, the microbes from the communities conditioned by plant diets made their way into the   microbiome. It’s not clear how that translates to humans: Mice eat one another’s droppings when they live together, so they easily share the bacterial wealth. Still, it’s possible humans have other ways of sharing bacteria, Dr. Griffin said. “We know from previous work and other studies that spouses who live together will develop microbial communities that are similar to each other,” he said. Perhaps the best way to cultivate a healthier microbiome is to eat more fiber by consuming more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts or seeds, said Meghan Jardine, a registered dietitian who was not involved in the current study but has published articles on promoting a healthy microbiota. (She is also affiliated with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which recommends a   diet.) She urges people to aim for 40 to 50 grams of fiber daily, well above levels recommended by most dietary guidelines. “When you look at populations that eat real food that’s high in fiber, and more   foods, you’re going to see they have a more robust microbiota, with more genetic diversity, healthier species and fewer pathogenic bacteria living in the gut,” she said."
